A driver is a software that allows your computer to communicate with your printer and other devices. Without a driver, your printer might not work properly or at all. Therefore, it is important to download and install the latest driver for your Canon imageRUNNER 2420L printer.
 
Fortunately, you can download the driver for free from the official Canon website. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Go to [https://www.canon-europe.com/support/products/imagerunner/imagerunner-2420.html](https://www.canon-europe.com/support/products/imagerunner/imagerunner-2420.html) [^1^]. This is the support page for the Canon imageRUNNER 2420 series, which includes the 2420L model.
2. Select your operating system and language from the drop-down menus. This will show you the available drivers and software for your printer.
3. Click on the "Drivers" tab and find the driver that matches your operating system and version. For example, if you are using Windows 10 64-bit, you should look for "UFRII LT Printer Driver V30.40".
4. Click on the "Download" button next to the driver name. This will start downloading a file named "o1597en\_w\_UFRIILT3040\_32\_64.exe". Save this file to a location where you can easily find it later.
5. Once the download is complete, double-click on the file to run it. This will launch the installation wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver on your computer.
6. When the installation is finished, restart your computer and connect your printer to it using a USB cable or a network connection.
7. You should now be able to use your Canon imageRUNNER 2420L printer with your computer.
